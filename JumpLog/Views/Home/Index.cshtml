    Notes from Alex
    - SQL Lite - easy to use, not very good with enterprise apps
    - SQL Server - good for enterprise use
    - Entity Framework - makes connecting app to database simpler
    - .NET Core vs .NET Framework - Core is newer and cross-platform, MSFT recommends .Net Core if given the choice
    - Don't worry about having to redesign app later on as you learn more

    Github Notes
    - Clone this repository to your computer
    - 'git branch <name of branch>'
        - Creates a branched copy for you to work with
    - 'git checkout <name of branch>'
        - Switches to the new branch for you
    - 'git merge main'
        - Merges any changes to the main repo with the branched repo
    - 'git status'
        - Shows files that have been changed but not committed to github
    - 'git commit -m "message you want to write for this commit"'
        - Saves your changes in git with the message you give
    - 'git push -u origin <name of branch>'
        - Sends your branch up to github
    - On github you can then:
        - Review changes and compare to main repo
        - Leave notes for person who sent up the changes
        - Merge changes into main
    - Once merged, in your own terminal do:
        - 'git checkout main' to switch back to the main repo
        - 'git pull' to download any changes and update your copy of the main repo
